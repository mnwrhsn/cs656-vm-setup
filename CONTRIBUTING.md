## How to Contribute

- **Improvement**. Improve the existing SEED labs. 
If you are interested in improving the existing SEED labs, you can start
creating a fork from this repo, and check the existing issues, and starting
working on that. When you are done, submit a pull request for our review.
If you have questions, you can always ask us by creating an issue.

  - If you find anything that can improve some of the existing tasks, 
    we would like to hear 
    about it. You can either directly submit your improvement through
    a pull request or create an issue to tell us about the ideas. 
    
  - Inside some of the lab folders, we have a ```TODO.md``` file, 
    which describes what we would like to do. Those are good places
    to start. If you are able to work on any of those, please 
    let us know by creating an issue. 

  - Search for existing issues with label "help wanted" to find out 
    the specific things 
    we are looking for. If you are very new in open-source projects, 
    you can start from the issues labeled "good first issue". 


- **New labs**. Developing new SEED labs. There are many topics that are 
not covered by the existing SEED labs. If you have expertise in those 
topics, and are interested in developing
one or multiple SEED labs on that topic, we would like to hear your 
proposal, and will work with you to get things started. Here is 
an incomplete list of topics that we are interested in:

  - Forensics
  - Reverse engineering
  - Intrusion detection
  - Blockchain 
  - Security in AI 
  - More labs on web application security
  - More labs on mobile app security

- **Testing**. We are constantly developing new labs. You can help us
test these labs and provide feedback during the development phase.

- **Translation**. Translating these SEED labs into other languages. 
We will create a separate github repository for each language. We look
for people who can take a lead on the translation for each language. 

- **Website**. Maintaining the website, designing artwork (e.g. icons) for each lab.

- **Providing technical supports to instructors**. We would like to help
the instructors around the world to adopt SEED labs in their curricula.
Some of them may encounter issues while working on the labs. 
We look for people who can provide help to them.
