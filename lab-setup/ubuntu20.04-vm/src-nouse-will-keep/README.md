The folder contains scripts to build a SEED VM that 
includes everything for the SEED labs. This is for
our original VM version, but since then, we have moved
many things into the container images. Therefore,
a number of things included in these scripts are 
no longer needed. We still keep this folder here,
but the most recent Ubuntu 20.04 VM is built 
from the scripts in the `src-slim` folder.
