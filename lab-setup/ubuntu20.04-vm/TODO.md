# TODO

We will document issues and suggestions coming up during the beta testing. 

- Put the SEED alias in `.bash_aliases`, instead of putting them in
the `.bashrc` file. This way, the aliases can be easily imported
to other shells. This file is sourced by a command inside 
the `.bashrc` file.  Need to update the files in the and `src-vm` folders. 
The `src-cloud` folder already uses this.
