# Elgg Docker Images

Update: we have decided to only use the original image.
`handsonsecurity/seed-elgg:original`. Customization for the 
CSRF and XSS labs will be made in their own Lab setup file.

Therefore, the `csrf-old` and `xss-old` folders are no longer
needed, and they will be removed in the future.
